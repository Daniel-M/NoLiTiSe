*==================================*

NoLiTiSe consists of a series of programs oriented to 
Non Linear Time Series Analisis (Yap, there comes the name)
By now there are just few files on the repo, those are described 
below:

  FILE NAME:   commonroutines.c
  DESCRIPTION: This code consist of a collection of useful self-made routines
      
  AUTHOR:      Daniel Mejia Raigosa
  DATE:        17, May 2011

  FILE NAME:   embedding-main.c
  DESCRIPTION: This code consist of a simple embedding process by passing 
               the data origin file name as argv[1] and the resulting embedding
	       dimention as argv[2] when executing the program.
	       the program creates the file "filename-embedding.ext" as a 
	       result of the successful working.
	       Max Data handling 10000 data lines - it can be modified on the
	       #define MAXDATA value
